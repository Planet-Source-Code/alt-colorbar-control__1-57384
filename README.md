### Description

This control can be a level meter (with peaks) for visualizations, a seekbar, a progress bar, or just a gradient/solid line. I consider this control to now be in beta so feedback with regard to bugs encountered, optimizations, enchancements, feature suggestions/requests are most desired. I would also like to hear suggestions on how I can improve the gradient routines. I know some excellent gradient routines have been posted recently, especially Light Templer's/LaVolpe's, but they are only 2 color and I have struggled with integrating them into my control...any help would be welcome and appreciated.
